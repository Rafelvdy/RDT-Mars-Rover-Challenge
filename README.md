Thank you very much for the opportunity to complete this project.
This took me between 3 and 4 hours, however, as i was not able to do it in one sitting, sometime was spent trying to rememeber what i was doing in the program. Next time i would complete in one sitting so that i can more efficiently develop the code.
I found that the logic of passing information through objects was the hardest bit for me as it was time consuming to think about what method to use and i had to use some trial and error for the code until i got it right.
